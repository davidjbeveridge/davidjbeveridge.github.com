## Work

### Radial Development Group

*[Radial Development Group][radial] is an agile, process/practice-focused
consulting firm based in beautiful Loveland, Colorado.*

I have the pleasure of advising Radial Development Group. Radial puts great
weight on accountability, which I help faciliate by moderating weekly
retrospectives. This gives the whole staff a forum to discuss absolutely
anything relevant to the company, and address anything direclty with
managment and a third-party advocate (me).  I have coached them through
mutliple stages of growth as a company, and have watched their team flourish.

In addition to the process-oriented work I do with them, I have also provided
technical advise, including an on-site training day (Sept.  2015) on
Test-driven JavaScript ([slides][tdd-in-js]) with React ([tdd-react]) and
Backbone ([tdd-backbone]).

*Role: Adviser*

*Methodologies: Agile Retrospectives, SMART Goals, 5 Why's, pragmatism,
communication skills, mediation*

### The Firehose Project

*[The Firehose Project][firehose] is an online learning platform for aspiring
web developers*

I work with The Firehose Project as a mentor. I get to coach aspiring
developers through their curriculum, provide customized learning opportunities
to nudge them in their preferred direction, and provide some career coaching
and direction.

*Role: Mentor*

*Technologies: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap, etc.*

### Stateless Networks

*Stateless Networks (now [Luminus Networks][luminus]) provides
software for monitoring and provisioning physical networks at scale.*

I was privileged to serve as the front-end technical lead for the first
several versions of Stateless' Network Automation Engine (NAE). We were
initially engaged for three weeks, during which we created a working prototype
that could monitor a small bank of real Arista switches, and display real-time
updates. Over the ensuing year, I led a team of 3-4 frontend/fullstack
developers in building out a full-featured product that would work at scale.
We developed an event-driven automation engine that allowed users to set up
highly specific queries and tie them to notifications, deployments, and custom
provisioning scripts. In addition to writing the code, I was responsible for
the front-end architecture, the UX, domain knowledge, and part of the product
development and domain knowledge.

Stateless was the first fully test-driven front-end that Originate delivered.
I set high technical standards for the team, and coached team members to meet
those standards. The hard focus on tests and quality allowed us to iterate
quickly and we were able to consistently deliver a high-quality product on a
tight timeline, which allowed the Stateless business team to raise the capital
they needed, and consistently wow both investors and customers.

*Role: Lead Front-end Developer*

*Technologies: Ruby on Rails, Spine.js, jQuery, WebSockets, Python, Twitter
Bootstrap, Git, Mocha.js, Cucumber, CoffeeScript, TDD*

### MGM International

I had the good fortune to lead a team of new engineers in an on-site
engagement with MGM International. Our task was to rescue an internal product
that was behind schedule, as well as to assess the existing process and
deliver a report on any improvements that could be made.

This project was a prime opportunity to mentor the new engineers on my team in
working with legacy code, and to work directly with them on their business
communication skills, and project planning. I also got to teach my team how to
use JavaScript, and how to use jQuery, Backbone.js, the Jasmine test
framework, and the Cucumber acceptance testing tool. We were able to deliver
the internal tool that other firms had failed to deliver, and delivered a
clear report identifying specific areas where their development process could
be improved.

*Role: Lead Front-end Developer*

*Technologies: JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone.js, Spring Framework, Apache
Tomcat, Cucumber, Jasmine.js, Subversion (SVN)*

### Angie's List

*[Angie's List][angieslist] collects review data on more than 720 different
domestic services, and helps to connect over 3 million households with
reliable service providers, including roofers, plumbers, handymen, mechanics,
doctors and dentists. In markets where their SnapFix service is deployed,
consumers can access white-glove service, where Angie's List will manage a
whole job for them, from discovery to payment, and follow up with service
providers about any issue that arises.*

#### ATC Dashboard

My first engagement with Angie's List was building their Air Traffic Control
dashboard; the software that their call-center operators use to manage service
requests and dispatch service providers for their Snapfixâ„¢ service. I worked
on a small, tight-knit team that was able to quickly iterate and develop new
capabilities in the dashboard as the underlying API became available
elsewhere.

I was brought on after the tools had been chosen; once I joined the project, I
did my best to ensure high technical standards, requiring test-driven
front-end code, and coached another engineer on test-driven development.
Despite his initial reluctance, I was able to help him to understand the value
in writing test-driven code, and have since seen him become a zealous advocate
for writing clean, well-tested code on a variety of platforms.

*Role: Lead Front-end Developer*

*Technologies: Spine.js, Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery, Scala, Play Framework,
CoffeeScript, Mocha*

#### Angie's List Service Provider Portal / Frontend

I had occasion to work closely with an internal team at Angie's List to
make-over their Service Provider Portal, and a portion of their public-facing
website. I was brought on as a senior technical adviser, and developer.
Working with a larger team with mixed skillsets was gratifying. I was afforded
the chance to mentor team members in using TDD and in using React.js, along
with the Flux architecture. I'm proud to have worked with this team, and to
have left both the project and the team better than I found them.

*Role: Senior Front-end Developer, Senior Technical Adviser*

*Technologies: React.js, Flux / Alt, Twitter Bootstrap, Scala, Play Framework,
ES6 / ES7 / ES2015*

### Risk Management Solutions

*[Risk Management Solutions][rms] (RMS) is the world's leading provider of
catastrophe risk modeling services and actuarial data for insurers and
re-insurers.*

I worked on an internal tool for Risk Mangement Solutions (RMS) for managing
their datasets. The product enabled users to work with large (several GB)
data-sets in the browser, and provide real-time information about batched data
processing. During my tenure on this project, I wrote world-class code, and
provided coaching and technical insight to the team.

*Role: Senior Front-end Developer*

*Technologies: React.js, Redux, Flux Architecture, CoffeeScript, Moment.js,
TDD*

### Versus

*[Versus][versus] is a fully legal (presently US-only) proprietary platform
that allows game publishers and developers to offer physical, digital, and
monetary prizes in skill-based tournaments and matches.*

I worked with Versus to develop their tournament platform. I was fortunate to
inherit the codebase in a well-engineered state. Over the course of several
weeks, I helped to refine some of the software requirements and rewrite
affected parts of the system. In particular, I added a double-entry accounting
system that would account for all the various parties involved in the
sometimes-complex tournament payouts.

*Role: Senior Ruby Developer*

*Technologies: Ruby on Rails, Cucumber, RSpec, Grape.rb*

### Dispatch.me Scheduling Dashboard

*[Dispatch][dispatch] helps field service companies manage jobs from start to
finish, connecting all the dots between job originator, customer, and service
provider in the field.*

I led a small team in upgrading part of Dispatch's scheduling dashboard. We
rewrote the scheduling component using React.js and Kendo UI. I coached an
excellent back-end developer in doing front-end development with JavaScript,
and helped to work through the hurdles of the Kendo UI integration.

*Role: Senior JavaScript Developer*

*Technologies: React.js, Kendo UI, Redux, Flux, Radium*

### CardGnome Web-to-Print System

*[Card Gnome][cardgnome] is a greeting card company, specializing in
direct-to-recipient delivery.*

While working at Card Gnome, I developed a complete system for creating
greeting cards online and delivering high-quality custom prints directly to
customers.

*Role: Senior Full-stack Developer*

*Technologies: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, Prawn.rb, ImageMagick*

## Presentations

### TDD In JavaScript
[http://davidbeveridge.net/TDD-in-JavaScript/index.html](http://davidbeveridge.net/TDD-in-JavaScript/index.html)

A three-part talk I gave Sept. 18, 2015 for [Radial Development
Group](http://radialdevgroup.com/) on doing Test-Driven Development with
JavaScript. The slides mostly cover TDD as a practice. This was followed by
sections on doing TDD with Backbone.js and React.js, both with some live coding
as an example.

### Is this thing on? Testing JavaScript, 1, 2, 3.
[https://github.com/davidjbeveridge/TDD-is-this-thing-on](https://github.com/davidjbeveridge/TDD-is-this-thing-on)

Presented May 27, 2015 at the Colorado Springs JavaScript Meetup, this was the
first version of my talk on TDD with JavaScript. I covered TDD as a practice,
and then did some live code demonstrating TDD on a sample project, which was a
proof-of-concept for a script loader that only executes scripts matching a known
hash. 

### ActiveRecord Migrations
[http://davidbeveridge.net/ActiveRecord-Migrations-Presentation](http://davidbeveridge.net/ActiveRecord-Migrations-Presentation)

I originally presented this talk in 2012 to the Las Vegas Ruby Group. The group
was making our way through "The Rails 3 Way", and I presented on ActiveRecord
Migrations. Much of the information for this talk was taken from Chapter 6, and
opined in person.
