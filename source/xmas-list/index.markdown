Just a few ideas.

- [Leather Writing Portfolio][padfolio]

  I'd like a simple, thin padfolio. No zippers, calculator or any of the other
  bulky features that so many of them have. Brown leather is preferable.

- X-Large Plain White Crew T-Shirts [Hanes][hanes-tshirts] or [Fruit of the
  Loom][fotl-tshirts]

- [SanDisk Ultra Fitâ„¢ CZ43 32GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive][sandisk-usb]

- Light-roast, whole-bean coffee. In particular, I like Gevalia's Traditional
  Roast

- Book: [The Juggling Act: Bringing Balance to Your Faith, Family, and Work][juggling-act]

- Gift cards: [Chipotle][chipotle] and [Starbucks][starbucks] are good
  choices.
