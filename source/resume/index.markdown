## Presentations

### TDD In JavaScript
[http://davidbeveridge.net/TDD-in-JavaScript/index.html](http://davidbeveridge.net/TDD-in-JavaScript/index.html)

A three-part talk I gave Sept. 18, 2015 for [Radial Development
Group](http://radialdevgroup.com/) on doing Test-Driven Development with
JavaScript. The slides mostly cover TDD as a practice. This was followed by
sections on doing TDD with Backbone.js and React.js, both with some live coding
as an example.

### Is this thing on? Testing JavaScript, 1, 2, 3.
[https://github.com/davidjbeveridge/TDD-is-this-thing-on](https://github.com/davidjbeveridge/TDD-is-this-thing-on)

Presented May 27, 2015 at the Colorado Springs JavaScript Meetup, this was the
first version of my talk on TDD with JavaScript. I covered TDD as a practice,
and then did some live code demonstrating TDD on a sample project, which was a
proof-of-concept for a script loader that only executes scripts matching a known
hash. 

### ActiveRecord Migrations
[http://davidbeveridge.net/ActiveRecord-Migrations-Presentation](http://davidbeveridge.net/ActiveRecord-Migrations-Presentation)

I originally presented this talk in 2012 to the Las Vegas Ruby Group. The group
was making our way through "The Rails 3 Way", and I presented on ActiveRecord
Migrations. Much of the information for this talk was taken from Chapter 6, and
opined in person.
